## Installation

### Download the Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiaohan-Tian/spotllm.git
cd spotllm
```

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- **Node.js**: v20.18.0 or later

### Running from Source

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

### Packaging the Application

To create a distributable package:

```bash
npm run dist
```

This will create two files in the `dist` directory:
- `SpotLLM-1.0.0.dmg`: Installer package
- `SpotLLM-1.0.0-mac.zip`: Portable version

You can install the app by double-clicking the `.dmg` file, dragging the app to the Applications folder, or by running the `.app` file.

### Running on macOS (Security Bypass)

Since the app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS might show a security warning when you try to open it. To bypass this:

1. When you first try to open the app, right-click (or Control-click) on the app icon and select "Open"
2. macOS will show a warning saying it "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"
3. Click "Open" in the warning dialog
4. The app will launch and future launches will work normally without requiring these steps

Note: You only need to do this once. After that, the app will open normally.

### Settings Migration (Optional)

If you're sharing settings between computers, the configuration file is located at:
`~/Library/Application Support/spotllm/config.json`

To transfer settings:
1. Copy this file from your existing installation
2. Place it in the same location on the new computer after installing but before running SpotLLM for the first time
